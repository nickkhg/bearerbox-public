        <p>BearerBox is a Safari extension that allows developers to inspect browser storage values, decode JSON Web Tokens, and create and run custom JavaScript actions on webpages. The Extension operates entirely within your browser and does not require an account or internet connection to function.</p>

        <h2>License</h2>
        <p>BearerBox grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Extension for personal or professional purposes, subject to these terms. You may not redistribute, sublicense, reverse-engineer, or create derivative works based on the Extension.</p>

        <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You are solely responsible for the custom JavaScript actions you create and execute using BearerBox. You agree not to use the Extension to:</p>

        <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>All rights, title, and interest in and to BearerBox, including its code, design, and documentation, remain the exclusive property of the developer. These terms do not grant you any rights to the Extension&rsquo;s trademarks, branding, or intellectual property beyond the limited license described above.</p>

This includes, without limitation, damages for loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruption, regardless of the theory of liability.</p>

        <h2>Termination</h2>
